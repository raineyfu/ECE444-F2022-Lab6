Pros: 
Test Driven Development ensures there is testing for each feature this ensures that the code has good test coverage creating confidence. 
The testing also shows the expected behaviour of the code. Furthermore, this makes it easier to debug when issues do arise. 

Test Driven Development also makes it easier to refactor code. After making some changes you may be concerned that these changes could affect other parts of the code. However, since there is testing covering the other parts of code, you can be assured that your changes have not broken the existing code.

Similarly, Test Driven Development makes it easier to teammates to collaborate. Since there are existing tests, engineers can be assured that their changes won't affect other people's code if the tests pass. 

Test Driven Development also forces code to be more modular and have good architecture. The code must be able to be tested, this forces the code to be modular. Furthermore, by writing tests first, it can help engineers better understand the requirements and improve the architecture. 

Test Driven Development also saves time by catching "stupid" mistakes that were missed. This can save time debugging 

Cons: 
The goal of testing is to find bugs within the code base. However, testing is also a form of writing code and the testing code can have bugs as well. This can lead to false confidence or false negatives. 

Test driven development also takes more time to develop. It takes time to write tests for each feature. This time could potentially be better spent on development itself. 

Similarly, tests also need to be maintained. When the requirements or implentation changes, the testing will also need to be updated, using more time and resources.
